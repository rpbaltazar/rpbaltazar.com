Recently came against the deal of choosing a secure password for some random access. As usual, I ran a bunch of generators looking for a decent idea as I usually don&#8217;t like the results of the generators. They generate too much rubish, impossible to memorize unless you use it frequently.

This time, though, I came across this interesting [xkcd strip](http://xkcd.com/936/) that suggests a way to generate a strong password with little effort and easy to memorize.
