In order to use a custom font in a Rails 4 project, you can either put it under public folder (and configure the css path accordingly) or you can load it from assets folder.

First of all, I personally recommend that you read the [assets pipeline entry](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html). This will give you a fairly good idea on how to do it.

Nevertheless, given the two options here it goes:

**Option 1 &#8211;Â **load the font file from the public folder****

  1. Copy the font file to public/fonts/<whatever path you want>
  2. configure your css file to load the needed path
      1. Add the following to your css file
        `<br />
@font-face {<br />
font-family: 'VanCondensed';<br />
src:url("/fonts/VanCondensed-Regular.otf");<br />
font-weight: normal;<br />
font-style: normal;<br />
}`

**Option 2 &#8211; **load the font from the assets folder****

  1. Copy the font file to app/assets/fonts/<whatever path you want>
  2. Update your config file, so the project knows that it has to load the fonts folder
      1. config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join(&#8216;app&#8217;, &#8216;assets&#8217;, &#8216;fonts&#8217;)
  3. configure your css file to load the needed path
      1. Change the css file extension to css.erb
      2. Add the following to your css file
        `<br />
@font-face {<br />
font-family: 'VanCondensed';<br />
src:url("<%= asset_path('VanCondensed-Regular.otf') %>");<br />
font-weight: normal;<br />
font-style: normal;<br />
}`
  4. Restart your server
