The **oldest Metro System** in the world is **London&#8217;s**. It was **opened in 1863**, it has **270 stations** and covers **402 km**.

Even though being a huge surface coverage it **doesn&#8217;t make it the longest**, which is in **Seoul** and covers **526.3 km**. Seoul&#8217;s Metro, **opened in 1973** has **379 stations**. Despite having the largest coverage, Seoul&#8217;s metro does not make it to the top of highest number of stations.

**New York&#8217;s** metro system which has **468 stations **is the metro system with **most number of stations of the world**. Opened in **1868 as elevated** and then in **1904 underground** &#8220;only&#8221; covers 373 km though, leaving it behind London&#8217;s system.
