I&#8217;ve been using the lib MarkerWithLabel by Gary Little, available in <a title="here" href="http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerwithlabel/1.1.9/src/markerwithlabel.js" target="_blank">here</a>Â (check for the most recent version) and recently had a problem that took me a bit to figure out: How to update the label without having to remove the marker from the map and put it back again.

Therefore, I&#8217;ve made a few google queries and here is what i found to be the best solution:

<pre>marker.labelContent = ""+(index+1);
marker.label.draw();
</pre>
