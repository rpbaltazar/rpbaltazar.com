Hi, I'm Rui and I'm a software engineer. I currently work for [Perx Tech](https://perxtech.com) as a backend engineer.
I spend some of my spare time maintaining a couple of OSS projects. Two of my main projects I actively
maintain are [ros-apartment](https://github.com/rails-on-services/apartment) which is a drop in replacement
for the famous apartment gem while the other is a CLI tool to create branches based on ticket names and ids,
called [story_branch](https://github.com/story-branch/story_branch).
In this blog I write mostly about things I find interesting while developing in my daytime job or maintaining
the OSS projects, as well as notes I want to remember later on about information I found while navigating the internet.
This is intended to be used as a repository of ideas, thoughts, exercises, mostly somehow tech-related.
